# Define your app

<InlineAlert variant="warning" slots="text" />

**Adobe Commerce App Management is for Beta users only and is not yet accessible to all customers.**

The `app.commerce.config` file is the central configuration file for your App Builder application. It defines your app metadata, business configuration schema, and other settings:

1. **[App metadata](./app-metadata.md)**. Define the metadata for your app.

1. **[Business configuration](./configuration-schema.md)**. Specify the business configuration for your app.

1. **[Configure your project](./runtime-actions.md)**. Initialize the configuration library to generate the required runtime actions and project structure.
