# Port extensions to App Builder apps

Developers have traditionally used PHP to create in-process extensions that add features, functionality, services, and integrations to Adobe Commerce. This model requires any new code to be compatible with upgrades, the server's PHP version, and many other essential server applications and services that Commerce uses.

Adobe Developer App Builder uses out-of-process extensibility to avoid these compatibility issues. It provides a unified third-party extensibility framework for integrating and creating custom apps that extend Adobe Commerce. Since this extensibility framework is built on Adobe's infrastructure, developers can also extend Adobe Commerce with third-party systems.
