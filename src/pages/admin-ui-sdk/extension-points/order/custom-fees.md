# Order get custom fees

The `order get custom fees` extension point displays one or more customized fees or discounts on the following locations:

* The Orders Total section of the Create Order page and related pages in the Admin.
* Invoice pages in the Admin.
* Credit memo pages in the Admin.
* Order history pages on the storefront.

The fee amounts are in the base currency of the store.

## Example customizationâ€‹

The following example enables the display of two fees on the Admin and storefront. The first instance applies a $1.00 fee to all orders. The second instance applied a fee of $5.00 only when the order total is at least $20.00

```javascript

order: {
    getOrderCustomFees() {
      return [
        {
          id: 'test-fee-1',
          label: 'Test Fee 1',
          value: 1.00,
          applyFeeOnLastCreditMemo: false
        },
        {
