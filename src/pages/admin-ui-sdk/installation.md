## Prerequisites

### Adobe Commerce

* Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure or on premises: 2.4.5+
* PHP 8.1+
* [Adobe Identity Management Service (IMS) for Adobe Commerce](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/start/admin/ims/adobe-ims-integration-overview.html)

### Adobe App Builder

The [Adobe App Builder _Getting Started_ guide](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/getting_started/) lists the latest software requirements for creating App Builder apps.

## Installation steps

You can install the Admin UI SDK on Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure and on-premises instances.

### Enable Adobe IMS for Commerce

You must implement Adobe Identity Management Service (IMS) for Adobe Commerce to use the Admin UI SDK. [Configure the Commerce Admin Integration with Adobe ID](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/start/admin/ims/adobe-ims-config.html?lang=en) describes this process.
