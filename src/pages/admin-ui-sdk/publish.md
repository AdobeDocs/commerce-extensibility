# Prepare your app for production

After you have tested your app locally, you are ready to submit your app for approval. Once the app has been approved, it will be available in the Adobe App Registry. The Admin UI SDK can then be able to fetch the information it needs to create the app UI in Adobe Commerce.

During the testing phase, an administrator of your enterprise organization performs the approvals. At this point, your app is not public.

[Publishing Your First App Builder Application](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/getting_started/publish_app/) in the _App Builder Getting Started_ guide describes how to publish your app. Deploy your app to your Production workspace, then use the following steps:

1. Submit for publishing approval on your Adobe Developer Console.

1. Your app must be approved by an enterprise organization administrator. Your administrator uses the My Exchange panel in the Developer Console to perform this task. Upon approval, the app is published and available for use by employees within your enterprise organization. Adobe Commerce can now find the app in the App Registry."

1. Perform all testing. If any changes need to be made to your app, ask the administrator to reject the app within the My Exchange utility. Update your code and resubmit your app for approval. Repeat these steps until you have completed all testing.
