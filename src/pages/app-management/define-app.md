# Define your app

<InlineAlert variant="warning" slots="text" />

**Adobe Commerce App Management is for Beta users only and is not yet accessible to all customers.**

Before deploying your App Builder application to App Management, you must define its metadata, business configuration, and configure your project by setting up the required runtime actions:

1. **[App metadata](./app-metadata.md)**. Define the metadata for your app.

1. **[Business configuration](./configuration-schema.md)**. Specify the business configuration for your app.

1. **[Configure your project](./runtime-actions.md)**. Initialize the configuration library to generate the required runtime actions and project structure.
