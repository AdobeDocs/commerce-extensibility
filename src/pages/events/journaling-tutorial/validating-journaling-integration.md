# Validating Journalling Events Processing

## List Recent Activations:

Run the follwing command:

```bash
 aio rt activations list --limit 10
 ```

**What it does:**
Lists the last 10 activations (executions) in Adobe I/O Runtime. It shows both triggers (for example, everyMin) and actions (for example, journalaction), along with their status, execution time, and IDs.
Sample output (masked):

```bash
  09/05 11:36:10 success nodejs:22 0.0.1 ************ warm 15 0 143ms journalseptember/journalaction 
  09/05 11:36:10 success trigger 0.0.1 ************ -- -- -- -- everyMin 
  09/05 11:35:10 success nodejs:22 0.0.1 ************ warm 6 0 231ms journalseptember/journalaction 
  09/05 11:35:10 success trigger 0.0.1 ************ -- -- -- -- everyMin 
  09/05 11:32:10 success trigger 0.0.1 ************ -- -- -- -- everyMin
  ```

trigger everyMin > Scheduler fired.
journalaction (nodejs:22) > Action executed.
success > Run completed without errors.
duration (ms) > Execution time.

## View Logs from the Action

When an action entry appears (for example, nodejs:22 journalseptember/journalaction), copy its activation ID and run:

```bash
aio rt activation logs <ACTIVATION_ID>
```

**What it does:**
Displays the stdout/stderr logs generated by the action during execution. Use it to debug and verify that journalling logic executed correctly.

### Case A: No new events

The activation logs shows 0 Events in logs.This means the action ran successfully but no new events were available.

```bash
2025-09-05T06:06:10.574Z stdout: [journalaction] info: Fetching events from journalling endpoint... 
2025-09-05T06:06:10.675Z stdout: [journalaction] info: Last Position >>> ************ 
2025-09-05T06:06:10.713Z stdout: [journalaction] info: Fetched 0 new event(s).
```

### Case B: Event read from Commerce

When an event is read by the journal, the logs display the raw payload and event details.
This indicates the journal successfully read a Commerce event (in this example, a productdelete event) and updated the last processed position.
In Developer Console > Projects → **projectname** > stage > Events > Event Browser, the Last read position should match what appears in the logs. This confirms the event was fully processed.

```bash
   2025-09-05T06:28:10.754Z stdout: [journalaction] info: Raw Payload: { ... } <-- masked payload 
   2025-09-05T06:28:10.754Z stdout: [journalaction] info: Event ID: ************
   2025-09-05T06:28:10.754Z stdout: [journalaction] info: Type: com.adobe.commerce.productdelete 
   2025-09-05T06:28:10.754Z stdout: [journalaction] info: Time: 
   2025-09-05T06:27:02.455Z 
   2025-09-05T06:28:10.754Z stdout: [journalaction] info: SKU: fcdcd 2025-09-05T06:28:10.782Z stdout: [journalaction] info: Updated last processed position: 
  ```

##  Inspect the Action Result

Run:

```bash
aio rt activation result <ACTIVATION_ID>
```

**What it does:**
Shows the returned result/output of the action execution, such as a success confirmation or event details.

## Validate End-to-End Flow

- Ensure everyMin appears once every minute.
- Ensure each trigger is followed by journalaction.
- Both must show success.
- If logs say “Fetched 0 new event(s)” > the system is healthy but idle.
- If logs show a raw payload → an event was received and processed from Commerce.
