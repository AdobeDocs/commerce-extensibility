# customer mass action

The `customer mass action` extension point customizes customer grid mass actions in the Adobe Commerce Admin.

## Example customizationâ€‹

The following example creates mass actions labeled `First App Mass Action` and `Another Mass Action`. The `extensionId` value matches the ID specified at [app registration](../../app-registration.md).

The `path` parameter specifies where to redirect an action. The Admin UI SDK provides the selected product IDs in a [`sharedContext`](../../extension-points/index.md#shared-contexts) when a merchant selects a mass action. Your implementation must read the selected items from the `sharedContext`.

```javascript
customer: {
    massActions: [
        {
            actionId: `${extensionId}::customer-mass-action`,
            label: 'Customer Mass Action',
            confirm: {
                title: 'Mass Action',
                message: 'Are you sure your want to proceed with Mass Action on selected customers?'
            },
            path: '#/customer-mass-action',
            selectionLimit: 1
        },
        {
            actionId: `${extensionId}::mass-action-with-redirect`,
            label: 'Mass Action With Redirect',
            title: 'Customer Mass Action With Redirect',
            path: '#/mass-action-with-redirect'
        }
    ]
}
```
