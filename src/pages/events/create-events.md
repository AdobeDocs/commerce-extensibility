# Create event subscriptions from the Admin

<InlineAlert variant="info" slots="text1" />

Adobe Commerce as a Cloud Service (SaaS) customers can create event subscriptions from the Admin or by using [REST](./api.md) calls. (Platform as a Service (PaaS) customers must either use REST or create a custom module.) SaaS does not support all possible events. To view the list of supported events, select **System** > Events > **Events List**. Contact Customer Support if you would like to implement other events.

## View event subscriptions

In the Admin, select **System** > Events > **Events Subscriptions** to display the _Events Subscriptions_ grid page.

![Events Subscriptions grid page](../_images/events/events-subscriptions-grid.png)

The rows of this grid show configuration settings for all event subscriptions, both enabled and disabled.

## Create a new event subscription

Click **Add New Subscription** from the grid page to display the form for creating a new event subscription.

![New event subscription](../_images/events/event-subscription-settings.png)

The **Event subscription settings** configuration panel contains the following fields:

Field | Description
--- | ---
**Event Name** | Select one of the supported Commerce event names from the dropdown. ACCS does not support all possible events. Open a support ticket to request additional events.
**Event Name Alias** | A unique alias name for the event. An alias is required for events that have rules configured.
**Event Provider** | Select the event provider to which the event should be delivered. If a workspace configuration is set for the provider, event metadata will be created and linked to the provider when the event subscription is saved.
**Is Enabled** | Indicates whether the event is enabled. Commerce does not emit disabled events.
**Priority** | Indicates whether the event has priority status. Priority events are sent within a second, whereas non-priority events can take up to 59 seconds to send.

### Configure event subscription fields

The **Event Subscription Fields** configuration panel allows you to define the fields of the event payload to transmit from Commerce. The name provides the path to the field in the event payload.

<SampleEvent />

<InlineAlert variant="info" slots="text" />

If you do not specify any fields, Commerce sends the entire event payload. Adobe recommends sending a limited number of fields per event. If you send all fields, you increase the risk of including sensitive or PCI compliance data in the event. In addition, specifying only the fields that are applicable to your business case is recommended for optimal performance and cost effectiveness.

The following example shows how three fields can be configured for the `observer.catalog_product_save_after` event:

```yaml
Name: entity_id
Name: sku
Name: is_new
```

The contents of an `observer.catalog_product_save_after` event are similar to the following:

```json
{
    "entity_id": "3",
    "sku": "test2",
    "is_new": "0"
}
```

#### Array of nested objects

<NestedEvent />

```yaml
Name: order_id
Name: items[].sku
Name: items[].qty
```

The contents of the transmitted event are similar to the following:

```json
{
   "order_id": "8",
   "items": [
      {
         "sku": "simple-product-2",
         "qty": "3.000000"
      },
      {
         "sku": "simple-product-1",
         "qty": "5.000000"
      }
   ]
}
```

### Configure event subscription rules

<ConditionalEvents />

#### Example

```yaml
Field: qty
Operator: lessThan
Value: 20

Field: category_id
Operator: in
Value: 3,4,5

Field: name
Operator: regex
Value: /^TV .*/i

Field: category.store_id
Operator: in
Value: 1,2
```

## Events Subscriptions grid actions

Click **Select** > **Edit** in the **Action** column of an event subscription's row to display a form for editing the subscription.

![Edit event subscription](../_images/events/edit-event-subscription.png)

Click **Select** > **Delete** in the **Action** column to delete an event subscription.
