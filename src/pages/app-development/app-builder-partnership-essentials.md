# Adobe Developer App Builder partnership essentials

When a new collaboration starts between Adobe and our partners, one of the first steps is getting to know more about you as a partner. When you reach out to Adobe, sharing your interest in app building, Adobe will ask the following questions:

- Will you publish an application as an individual or on behalf of a company?
- Whose name will you publish the application under?
- What is your area of expertise (for example, payments, checkout, marketing, social, or tax)?
- Who will own and maintain the application?
- Are you committed to building and publishing the application?
- How much time or resources are you able to devote to this application development?

## Requirements to access App Builder

- **Membership requirements** - To build and publish an application, you must have a Silver tier membership or higher, which gives you sandbox access and the possibility to publish on the Adobe Exchange Marketplace. Start with your membership and reach out to Adobe to share your objectives on app building and start a collaboration between your team and ours. We commit to our partners and will support you if you have questions or need help during the development stage.

- **Account requirements** (Technology Partner Program) - The next step is to [create a Technology Partner Program (TPP) account](https://partners.adobe.com/technologyprogram/experiencecloud/registration.html), which is required to access App Builder, the Adobe Commerce as a Cloud Service sandbox and the App Builder sandbox, whether you are a Solution Implementer (SI) or Tech partner.

<InlineAlert variant="info" slots="text"/>

If you are a Solution Partner Program (SPP) partner, you will need to create a Technology Partner Program (TPP) account to access these environments.

### Request a Technology Partner Program (TPP) account

1. [Join the Technology Partner Program (TPP)](https://partners.adobe.com/technologyprogram/experiencecloud/registration.html) by using your personal corporate email address. Each registrant will need to use an Adobe ID. After joining, Adobe will assign an Independent Software Vendor (ISV), a TPP organization, and an App Builder sandbox associated with that organization.

1. **Additional users** - The first TPP registrant using their Adobe ID email is associated with the TPP organization. Any additional users who need to submit or manage App Builder listings need to have their Adobe ID email added to the TPP organization. You can do so by creating a case ticket with [TPP Support](https://partners.adobe.com/ec/cform/case).

1. **Submission review** - After registration, Adobe will review your submission and notify you upon approval or rejection. If Adobe rejects your submission, you will be provided with next steps.

   Estimated waiting time for acceptance to the Technology Partner Program and access to the sandbox could be up to one week.

1. **Status check** - You can create additional tickets to check on your organization or sandbox enablement. Specify the name of your assigned TPP organization and ensure you sign in with the correct organization.

### Sandbox access

Once you are a Silver+ member and have set up your TPP account, you will need access to the following environments:

- **App Builder Sandbox** - automatically associated with a TPP organization (for newly provisioned TPP organizations). Older organizations without permission should request a sandbox through [TPP Support](https://partners.adobe.com/ec/cform/sandbox) and request access to the following Commerce Sandboxes on the same ticket (if needed).

- **Commerce PaaS Sandbox** â€“ Account Managers should request Composer entitlements for Adobe Commerce EE/B2B Access through [TPP Support](https://partners.adobe.com/ec/cform/sandbox).

- **Commerce SaaS Sandbox** - access follows the same process as PaaS. Please file a ticket to [TPP Support](https://partners.adobe.com/ec/cform/sandbox).

### Integrations

After partners get sandbox access, the Adobe Commerce engineering team will ask developers to extend the integration starter kit when getting started with App Builder development.

## How to build an app

1. Get started by learning more about [building an app](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/intro_and_overview/).

1. Install the [Adobe Commerce integration starter kit](../starter-kit/integration/create-integration.md).

1. Read the [App Submission guidelines](../app-development/app-submission-guidelines.md).

1. Understand the [Adobe Exchange Marketplace publishing requirements](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-distribution/experience-cloud/docs/guides/submission/app-builder-submission) to guide development.

1. Review the [developer guides](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/guides/app_builder_guides/) for [out-of-process apps](index.md) and [app distribution](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-distribution/experience-cloud/docs/guides/discoverAndManage/app-builder-discover).

**Support resources:**

- [Common issues](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/get_started/app_builder_get_started/troubleshoot).
- [Experience League forum](https://experienceleaguecommunities.adobe.com/t5/app-builder/ct-p/adobe-app-builder).
- Slack support channel in the [Magento Open Source Workspace](https://developer.adobe.com/open/magento/slack): `#app-builder-community`

## How to package your app

1. [Package and configure the app overview](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/guides/app_builder_guides/distribution/).

1. Internal publishing: Publish within the [partner's organization](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/get_started/app_builder_get_started/publish-app).

1. External publishing: Publish on the Adobe Exchange Marketplace. Read the following [distribution](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/get_started/app_builder_get_started/publish-app) section.

## Distribution

Before you distribute, you must be part of the [Technology Partner Program](#request-a-technology-partner-program-tpp-account).

Here are the distribution steps with use case for Commerce Solution Implementers and Independent Software Vendors:

1. **Create an App Builder listing:**

   - Sign into [Developer Distribution (DD)](https://developer.adobe.com/distribute) and confirm that your approved TPP organization appears in the upper-right organization switcher. If the organization name looks like your email address without the `@` sign, you are not in the TPP organization and will get an error when trying to create a listing.
   - [Create an App Builder listing](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-distribution/experience-cloud/docs/guides/submission/app-builder-submission#creating-a-listing) using the zip file you created when building your App Builder app.
   - Then create a public profile before submitting your first App Builder listing.

1. **Submit a listing for Review:**

   - Review the [Adobe Exchange Marketplace publishing requirements](./app-submission-guidelines.md) to ensure your submission is correct to avoid delaying approval of your listing.
   - Adobe brand and code reviewers will [review the App Builder listing](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-distribution/experience-cloud/docs/guides/submission/app-builder-submission#reviewing-a-submission) and provide confirmation upon approval. If it is incomplete, Adobe will provide you with feedback.

## Variations

- Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) can publish the listing under their name, if they have an Adobe ID associated with a TPP organization.
- Solution Implementers (SIs) can:
  - Publish the listing under their name, if they have joined the Technology Partner Program (TPP) with their Adobe ID associated with a TPP organization.
  - Publish on behalf of an ISV, if they are added to the TPP organization of the ISV. Provide evidence that ISV approves of SI publishing on their behalf by submitting a [TPP Support ticket](https://partners.adobe.com/ec/cform/case) and Adobe will provide the name of the organization to SI user to ensure they sign in to Developer Distribution (DD) under the correct organization.

<InlineAlert variant="info" slots="text, text1"/>

Any user with an Adobe ID associated with the TPP publishing organization can submit, manage, and retract an App Builder Listing in Developer Distribution.

Users updating or revising the App Builder App itself require Commerce and App Builder sandboxes in their organization.
