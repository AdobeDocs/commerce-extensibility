### Known limitations

Amazon Sales Channel on App Builder is a reference app that demonstrates how Adobe Developer App Builder can create integrations and extensions without modifying the core Commerce application. This app is not intended or supported for production use.

The sample app functionality represents only a subset of the original PHP extension's capabilities. For example, it does not include order management or listing and pricing rules.
