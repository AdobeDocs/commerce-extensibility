# Prepare your app for production

After you have tested your app locally, you must publish the app so that you can test and deploy it in a production environment. Publishing an app makes it available to the App Registry. As a result, Adobe Commerce can fetch the information it needs to augment the Admin.

[Publishing Your First App Builder Application](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/getting_started/publish_app/) in the _App Builder Getting Started_ guide describes how to get your app ready for production. Deploy your app to your Production workspace, then use the following steps:

1. Submit for publishing approval on your Adobe Developer Console. Your app must be approved by an enterprise organization administrator.  Upon approval, the app's status is updated to "Published". The app is available for use either by employees within your enterprise organization

1. Perform all testing. If any changes need to be made to your app, ask the administrator to reject the app within the My Exchange utility. Update your code and resubmit your app for approval. Repeat these steps until you have completed all testing.

1. When the administrator approves the app from within My Exchange, the app is published and available on Experience Cloud.
