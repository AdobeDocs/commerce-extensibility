# Validate journaling events processing

This topic guides you through validating that events from Adobe Commerce are successfully reaching the journaling endpoint and being processed by the runtime action.

## List recent activations

Run the following command to list the 10 most recent activations in Adobe I/O Runtime.

```bash
aio rt activations list --limit 10
```

This masked response shows both triggers and actions along with their status.

```terminal
09/05 11:36:10 success nodejs:22 0.0.1 ************ warm 15 0 143ms journalseptember/journalaction 
09/05 11:36:10 success trigger 0.0.1 ************ -- -- -- -- everyMin 
09/05 11:35:10 success nodejs:22 0.0.1 ************ warm 6 0 231ms journalseptember/journalaction 
09/05 11:35:10 success trigger 0.0.1 ************ -- -- -- -- everyMin 
09/05 11:32:10 success trigger 0.0.1 ************ -- -- -- -- everyMin
```

## View logs from the action

When an action entry appears (for example, `nodejs:22 journalseptember/journalaction`), copy its activation ID and run:

```bash
aio rt activation logs <ACTIVATION_ID>
```

The command displays the stdout/stderr logs generated by the action during execution. Use it to debug and verify that journaling logic executed correctly.

### Use case: No new events

The activation logs shows 0 Events in logs. This means the action ran successfully but no new events were available.

```terminal
2025-09-05T06:06:10.574Z stdout: [journalaction] info: Fetching events from journaling endpoint... 
2025-09-05T06:06:10.675Z stdout: [journalaction] info: Last Position >>> ************ 
2025-09-05T06:06:10.713Z stdout: [journalaction] info: Fetched 0 new event(s).
```

### Use case: Event read from Commerce

When an event is read by the journal, the logs display the raw payload and event details.
This indicates the journal successfully read a Commerce event (in this example, a productdelete event) and updated the last processed position.
In Developer Console > Projects â†’ **projectname** > stage > Events > Event Browser, the Last read position should match what appears in the logs. This confirms the event was fully processed.

```terminal
2025-09-05T06:28:10.754Z stdout: [journalaction] info: Raw Payload: { ... } <-- masked payload 
2025-09-05T06:28:10.754Z stdout: [journalaction] info: Event ID: ************
2025-09-05T06:28:10.754Z stdout: [journalaction] info: Type: com.adobe.commerce.productdelete 
2025-09-05T06:28:10.754Z stdout: [journalaction] info: Time: 
2025-09-05T06:27:02.455Z 
2025-09-05T06:28:10.754Z stdout: [journalaction] info: SKU: fcdcd 2025-09-05T06:28:10.782Z stdout: [journalaction] info: Updated last processed position: 
```

##  Inspect the action result

Run the following command using the same activation ID to view the action's returned result, such as a success confirmation or event details.

```bash
aio rt activation result <ACTIVATION_ID>
```

## Validate the end-to-end flow

- Ensure `everyMin` appears once every minute.
- Ensure each trigger is followed by `journalaction`.
- Both must show success.
- If logs say `"Fetched 0 new event(s)"`, the system is healthy but idle.
- If logs show a raw payload, an event was received and processed from Commerce.
