# Configure Adobe Commerce

After you have created an [App Builder project](./project-setup.md) and [install the eventing modules](./installation.md), you must download several files from the App Builder project and configure eventing in the Commerce admin.

## Configure the Adobe I/O connection

You must configure Commerce to communicate with your project. Configuration includes copying and pasting the contents of the [workspace configuration file](./project-setup.md#download-the-workspace-configuration-file) that you downloaded from the Adobe Developer Console. If you decided to use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) as your server-to server authentication method, you must also upload a private key.

1. In the Commerce Admin, navigate to **Stores** > Settings > **Configuration** > **Adobe Services** > **Adobe I/O Events** > **General configuration**. The following screen displays.

   ![General configuration](../_images/events/general-configuration.png)

1. Select the server-to-server authorization method you implemented from the **Adobe I/O Authorization Type** menu. Adobe recommends using OAuth. JWT has been deprecated.

1. (JWT only) Copy and paste the contents of your `private.key` file into the **Service Account Private Key** field. Use the following command to copy the contents.

   ```bash
   cat config/private.key | pbcopy
   ```

   See [Service Account (JWT) Authentication](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/authentication/JWT/) for more information about the `private.key` file.

1. Copy the contents of the `<workspace-name>.json` file into the **Adobe I/O Workspace Configuration** field.

1. Enter a unique identifier in the **Adobe Commerce Instance ID** field. This value must contain English alphanumeric characters, underscores (_), and hyphens (-) only.

1. Click **Save Config**, but do not leave the page. The next section creates an event provider, which is necessary to complete the configuration.

## Create an event provider and complete the Commerce configuration

You cannot create an event provider until you have configured and saved a workspace file and instance ID values. If you are using JWT for server-to-server authentication, you must also have previously specified the private key.

1. Run the following command to create an event provider:

   ```bash
   bin/magento events:create-event-provider --label "<unique_provider_label>" --description "<provider description>"
   ```

   For example:

   ```bash
   bin/magento events:create-event-provider --label "My_server_provider" --description "Provides out-of-process extensibility for Adobe Commerce"
   ```

   **Note**: The label can contain English alphanumeric characters and underscores (_) only. The first character must be a letter.

   The command displays a message similar to the following:

   ```terminal
   No event provider found, a new event provider will be created
   A new event provider has been created with ID 63a1f8fe-e911-45a4-9d3f
   ```

1. Copy the ID returned in the command output into the **Adobe I/O Event Provider ID** field in the Admin.

   ![Commerce events configuration](../_images/events/commerce-events.png)

1. Enable Commerce Eventing by setting **Enabled** to `Yes`.

   **Note**: You must [enable cron](#check-cron-and-message-queue-configuration) so that Commerce can send events to the endpoint.

1. Enter the merchant's company name in the **Merchant ID** field. You must use alphanumeric and underscores only.

1. In the **Environment ID** field, enter a temporary name for your workspaces while you are in development mode. When you are ready for production, change this value to a permanent value, such as **Production**.

1. (Optional) By default, if an error occurs when Adobe Commerce attempts to send an event to Adobe I/O, Commerce retries a maximum of seven times. To change this value, uncheck the **Use system value** checkbox and set a new value in the **Maximum retries to send events** field.

1. (Optional) By default, Adobe Commerce runs a cron job (clean_event_data) every 24 hours that deletes event data that is three days old. To change the number of days to retain event data, uncheck the **Use system value** checkbox and set a new value in the **Event retention time (in days)** field.

1. Click **Save Config**.

After you have completely configured and saved your Adobe I/O event connection and your event provider, you can click the **Send Test Event** button to determine the status of the connection. The response displays beneath the button.

## Subscribe and register events

You must define which Commerce events to subscribe to, then register them in the project.

Commerce provides two sources for events: observers and plugins. You must specify the source as part of the event name. See [Subscribe to a Commerce event](./commands.md) for details about the syntax of the `events:subscribe` command.

1. If you don't have a module ready for integration with Adobe I/O Events, or you don't know exactly which events to register at this point, use the `events:subscribe` command to subscribe to some sample events, as shown in the following example commands:

   ```bash
   bin/magento events:subscribe observer.catalog_product_save_after --fields=sku --fields=stock_data.qty
   ```

   ```bash
   bin/magento events:subscribe observer.customer_login --fields=firstname --fields=lastname --fields=entity_id
   ```

    **Warning**: When you use the `events:subscribe` command to subscribe to events on a Cloud environment, configuration information is stored in the `app/etc/config.php` file. You must keep in mind that this file can be replaced with the `app/etc/config.php` file from Git during deployment. As a result, the event subscription will be replaced as well.
   To make these changes permanent, manually add the appropriate configuration to the `app/etc/config.php` file under Git.

   If you have a module ready or have specific events in mind, see [Register events](./module-development.md#register-events) for more information.

1. Return to your workspace. Click the **Add service** pop-up menu and select **Event**.

   ![Click Add service in your workspace](../_images/events/add-event.png)

1. On the **Add events** page, select **Commerce events**. Then click **Next**.

   ![Select Commerce events](../_images/events/select-commerce-event.png)

   **Note:** If the **Commerce events** category is not shown, check that you have created an event provider, and that it has at least one subscribed event. You may need to run the `bin/magento events:metadata:populate` command to synchronize event registrations in Adobe Commerce with the created event provider.

1. On the **Configure event registration** page, select your event provider. Then click **Next**.

1. Select the events to subscribe to. Then click **Next**.

   ![Select the events to subscribe to](../_images/events/config-event-registration.png)

1. Optionally create a new OAuth or JWT credential. Then click **Next**.

1. Update the **Event registration name** and **Event registration description** fields. In the **How to receive events** section, under **Option 2**, select the runtime action you created in [Set up App Builder and define a runtime action](./project-setup.md#set-up-app-builder-and-define-a-runtime-action).

   ![Select a runtime action](../_images/events/select-runtime-action.png)

1. Select **Save configured events**.

You are now set up to develop your App Builder extension.

## Check cron and message queue configuration

Cron and message queues must be enabled. Commerce uses the `event_data_batch_send` cron job to transmit batches of event messages and the `clean_event_data` cron job to remove these messages from the database. These cron jobs are part of the `default` group.

The `commerce.eventing.event.publish` message queue consumer helps expedite registered events that have been designated as priority. The consumer processes priority events within a second of their receipt. By default, it can take up to 59 seconds for cron to process standard-priority events.

In Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure, update your `.magento.env.yaml` file with the following changes to the `global` and `deploy` stages:

```yaml
stage:
  global:
    ENABLE_EVENTING: true
  deploy:
    CRON_CONSUMERS_RUNNER:
      cron_run: true
      max_messages: 0
      consumers: []
```

<InlineAlert variant="warning" slots="text" />

The deployment process might become stuck if the consumer runs in the background. The [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md#stuck-deployment-after-configuring-priority-events) topic describes how to resolve this condition.

See [Global variables](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-cloud-service/user-guide/configure/env/stage/variables-global.html) for more information about the `ENABLE_EVENTING` variable.

Cloud infrastructure and on-premises instances require different cron management procedures as described here:

*  [On premises](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-operations/configuration-guide/crons/custom-cron-reference.html)
