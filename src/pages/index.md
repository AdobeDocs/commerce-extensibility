# Adobe Commerce extensibility

Learn about in-process and out-of-process development tools provided by Adobe Commerce

This guide explains how to develop Out-of-Process apps that extend and customize Adobe Commerce. For a more in-depth understanding of extensibility, follow our [learning path](./app-development/learning-path.md).

Extensibility, as a concept, reflects the possibility for growth and the ease of extending functionality in a system. When referring to extensibility in Adobe Commerce, we mean the ability of developers to expand, customize, and control their interactions with Adobe Commerce.

The following diagram highlights the main components of the Adobe Commerce [extensibility strategy](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-operations/implementation-playbook/architecture/extensibility-strategy.html):

Extensibility generally has two variations, in-process extensibility and out-of-process extensibility. In the context of Adobe Commerce, in-process extensibility refers to extended functionality that is located inside or alongside the Adobe Commerce core software. Conversely, out-of-process extensibility refers to extended functionality and services that operate outside the core software.

Out-of-process extensibility can reduce the total cost of ownership by simplifying upgrades and giving developers more control of the timing, coding, and implementation of their systems.

Other benefits of out-of-process extensibility include:

- Scalability - Extensions can be scaled separately from the core software, allowing for greater efficiency.

- Isolation - An isolated environment means that developers can upgrade or modify their extensions at their discretion without relying on a core release.

- Technological Independence - Developers can choose whichever tech stacks and coding languages that fit their needs.

## Out-of-process development tools

Adobe Commerce offers the following out-of-process development tools:

- [API Mesh for Adobe Developer App Builder](https://developer.adobe.com/graphql-mesh-gateway/) - Coordinate and combine multiple API, GraphQL, REST, and other sources into a single, queryable GraphQL endpoint.

- [App Builder](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/overview/) - Build and deploy secure and scalable web applications that extend Commerce functionality and integrate with third-party solutions.

- [Events](./events/index.md) - Use custom event triggers to interact with other extensible development tools.

- [Webhooks](./webhooks/index.md) - Use webhooks to automatically trigger interactions between Commerce and third-party systems.
